    <h1>Erik Howe</h1>
    <h2>
      I enjoy coding with Java and Kotlin. IntelliJ, Gradle, Maven and Spring
      are both my best friends and worst enemies! When I'm not writing code, I'm
      writing about writing code, lint rolling my clothes to get rid of fur from
      my Australian shepherd, or exploring different parts of my favorite city,
      New York.
